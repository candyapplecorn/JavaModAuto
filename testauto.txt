Adding optionsets is as easy as inserting a line,
and options for that option set come thereafter.
This text allows comments, optional "$" and blank lines

TESTING:
To easily test for broken input, simply place a || comment
in the middle of a sentence to truncate that sentence and see
exception handling in action. It's easier than deleting and re-writing!

These comments are totally original, I promise
Definitely not copying anything, no sir-e!
Just don't lean the pipes over, then we'd have a problem
